        $(P D provides an easy way to call C functions and operating
        system API functions, as compatibility with both is essential.
        The $(I LinkageType) is case sensitive, and is meant to be

        $(P Do not align references or pointers that were allocated

        $(P It is often necessary to deprecate a feature in a library,

        $(P Visibility is an attribute that is one of

        $(D public) or $(D export).
        )

        $(P They may be referred to as protection attributes in documents written
        before $(LINK2 http://wiki.dlang.org/DIP22, DIP22) was implemented.)

        $(P Symbols with $(D private) visibility can only be accessed from
        within the same module.
        Private member functions are implicitly final and cannot be overridden.
        )

        $(P $(D package) extends private so that package members can be accessed
        from code in other modules that are in the same package.
        If no identifier is provided, this applies to the innermost package only,
        or defaults to $(D private) if a module is not nested in a package.
        )

        $(P $(D package) may have an optional parameter, dot-separated identifier
        list which is resolved as the qualified package name. If this optional
        parameter is present, the symbol will be visible by this package and
        all its descendants.
        )

        $(P $(D protected) only applies inside classes (and templates as they can be mixed in)
        and means that a symbol can only be seen by members of the same module,
        or by a derived class.
        If accessing a protected instance member through a derived class member
        function, that member can only be accessed for the object instance
        which can be implicitly cast to the same type as $(SINGLEQUOTE this).
        $(D protected) module members are illegal.
        )

        $(P $(D public) means that any code within the executable can see the member.
        It is the default visibility attribute.
        )

        $(P $(D export) means that any code outside the executable can access the
        member. $(D export) is analogous to exporting definitions from a DLL.

        $(P Visibility participates in $(DDSUBLINK spec/module, name_lookup, symbol name lookup).

$(H3 $(LNAME2 const, $(D const) Attribute))

        $(P The $(D const) attribute changes the type of the declared symbol from $(D T) to $(D const(T)),

$(H3 $(LNAME2 immutable, $(D immutable) Attribute))

        $(P The $(D immutable) attribute modifies the type from $(D T) to $(D immutable(T)),

$(H3 $(LNAME2 inout, $(D inout) Attribute))

        $(P The $(D inout) attribute modifies the type from $(D T) to $(D inout(T)),
        the same way as $(D const) does.
        )

$(H3 $(LNAME2 shared, $(D shared) Attribute))

        $(P The $(D shared) attribute modifies the type from $(D T) to $(D shared(T)),
        the same way as $(D const) does.
        )

$(H3 $(LNAME2 gshared, $(D __gshared) Attribute))

        $(P By default, non-immutable global declarations reside in thread local
        storage. When a global variable is marked with the $(D __gshared)

        __gshared int bar;  // bar is shared by all threads.
        ---

        $(P $(D __gshared) may also be applied to member variables and local
        variables. In these cases, $(D __gshared) is equivalent to $(D static),
        except that the variable is shared by all threads rather than being
        thread local.)

        $(P Unlike the $(D shared) attribute, $(D __gshared) provides no

$(H3 $(LNAME2 disable, $(D @disable) Attribute))

        $(P A reference to a declaration marked with the $(CODE @disable) attribute causes
        a compile time error.

        at compile time rather than relying on generating a runtime error.

        It means that the function must override a function with the
        same name and parameters in a base class. The override attribute
        is useful for catching errors when a base class's member function
        gets its parameters changed, and all derived classes need to have

$(H3 $(LNAME2 static, $(D static) Attribute))

        $(P The $(D static) attribute applies to functions and data.
        It means that the declaration does not apply to a particular

$(P
        Static does not have the additional C meaning of being local

$(H3 $(LNAME2 scope, $(D scope) Attribute))

$(P
        The $(D scope) attribute is used for local variables and for class
        declarations. For class declarations, the $(D scope) attribute creates
        a $(I scope) class.
        For local declarations, $(D scope) implements the RAII (Resource
        Acquisition Is Initialization) protocol. This means that the
        destructor for an object is automatically called when the
        reference to it goes out of scope. The destructor is called even
        if the scope is exited via a thrown exception, thus $(D scope)
        is used to guarantee cleanup.
)
$(P
        If there is more than one $(D scope) variable going out of scope
        at the same point, then the destructors are called in the reverse
        order that the variables were constructed.
)
$(P
        $(D scope) cannot be applied to globals, statics, data members, ref
        or out parameters. Arrays of $(D scope)s are not allowed, and $(D scope)
        function return values are not allowed. Assignment to a $(D scope),

$(P
        An abstract member function must be overridden by a derived class.
        Only virtual member functions may be declared abstract; non-virtual
        member functions and free-standing functions cannot be declared
        abstract.
)

$(P
        Classes become abstract if any of its virtual member functions
        are declared abstract or if they are defined within an
        abstract attribute.
        Note that an abstract class may also contain non-virtual member functions.
)

$(P
        Classes defined within an abstract attribute or with abstract member
        functions cannot be instantiated directly.
        They can only be instantiated as a base class of
        another, non-abstract, class.
)

$(P
        Member functions declared as abstract can still have function
        bodies. This is so that even though they must be overridden,
        they can still provide $(SINGLEQUOTE base class functionality),
        e.g. through $(D super.foo()) in a derived class.
        Note that the class is still abstract and cannot be instantiated directly.

$(SECTION3 $(LNAME2 uda, User Defined Attributes),

        $(P
            User Defined Attributes (UDA) are compile time expressions that can be attached
            to a declaration. These attributes can then be queried, extracted, and manipulated
            at compile time. There is no runtime component to them.

@(3) int a;
@("string", 7) int b;

enum Foo;
@Foo int c;

struct Bar
{
    int x;

@Bar(3) int d;
---

        $(P
            If there are multiple UDAs in scope for a declaration, they are concatenated:
        )

---
@(1)
{
    @(2) int a;         // has UDA's (1, 2)
    @("string") int b;  // has UDA's (1, "string")
}
---

        $(P
            UDA's can be extracted into an expression tuple using $(D __traits):
        )

$(RUNNABLE_EXAMPLE
---
@('c') string s;
pragma(msg, __traits(getAttributes, s)); // prints tuple('c')
---
)
)

        $(P
            If there are no user defined attributes for the symbol, an empty tuple is returned.
            The expression tuple can be turned into a manipulatable tuple:
        )

$(RUNNABLE_EXAMPLE
---
template Tuple (T...)
{
    alias Tuple = T;
}

enum EEE = 7;
@("hello") struct SSS { }
@(3) { @(4) @EEE @SSS int foo; }

alias TP = Tuple!(__traits(getAttributes, foo));

pragma(msg, TP); // prints tuple(3, 4, 7, (SSS))
pragma(msg, TP[2]); // prints 7
---
)

        $(P
            Of course the tuple types can be used to declare things:
        )

---
TP[3] a; // a is declared as an SSS
---

        $(P
            The attribute of the type name is not the same as the attribute of the variable:
        )

---
pragma(msg, __traits(getAttributes, typeof(a))); // prints tuple("hello")
---

        $(P
            Of course, the real value of UDA's is to be able to create user defined types with
            specific values. Having attribute values of basic types does not scale.
            The attribute tuples can be manipulated like any other tuple, and can be passed as
            the argument list to a template.
        )

        $(P
            Whether the attributes are values or types is up to the user, and whether later
            attributes accumulate or override earlier ones is also up to how the user
            interprets them.
